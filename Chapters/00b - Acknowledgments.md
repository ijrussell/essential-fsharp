# Acknowledgments

Thanks to the reviewers of the previous releases of the book (Gianni Bossini, Yeray Cabello, Flavio Colavecchia, Emiliano Conti, David Dawkins, Martin Fuß, Erle Granger II, Viacheslav Koryagin, Mauricio Magni, Almir Mesic, Simon Painter, Sanket Patel, Eric Potter, and Cédric Rup) for helping to add some sparkle to the rough diamond that I created. 

Thanks to Flavio Corpa for the improved JavaScript used in Chapter 15.

Thanks to the many mentees that I've worked with over the last 36 months. Your dedication to learning and willingness to give feedback has been a real joy to me. I hope that you all go on to enjoy F# as much as I have over the last 14 years.

Thanks to Dustin Moris Gorski for [Giraffe](<https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe>), Krzysztof Cieślak and Chet Husk for their work on [ionide-fsharp](<https://ionide.io/>), the various people who have worked on the language and compilers over the years, and finally, last but not least, [Don Syme](<https://twitter.com/dsymetweets>) for creating the wonder that is the F# language. All Hail Don Syme!

Finally, thanks to Trustbit and all its employees for putting up with me over the last few years.
