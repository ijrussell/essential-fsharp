# Acknowledgments

Thanks to the reviewers of the original release of the book (Yeray Cabello, Emiliano Conti, Martin Fuß, Erle Granger II, Viacheslav Koryagin, and Cédric Rup) without whom it would have been a longer and more tortuous delivery.

Thanks to the reviewers of the revised edition (Gianni Bossini, Flavio Colavecchia, David Dawkins, Mauricio Magni, Almir Mesic, Simon Painter, Sanket Patel, and Eric Potter) for helping to add some sparkle to the rough diamond that I created.

Thanks to Flavio Corpa for the improved JavaScript used in Chapter 15.

Thanks to the many mentees that I've worked with over the last three years since publishing the first edition of this ebook. Your dedication to learning and willingness to give feedback has been a real joy to me. I hope that you all go on to enjoy F# as much as I have over the last 10 years.

Thanks to Dustin Moris Gorski for [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe), Krzysztof Cieślak and Chet Husk for their work on [ionide-fsharp](https://ionide.io/), the various people who have worked on the language and compilers over the years, and finally, last but not least, [Don Syme](https://twitter.com/dsymetweets) for creating the wonder that is the F# language. All Hail Don Syme!

Finally, thanks to Trustbit and all its employees for putting up with me over the last three years.
