# Summary

Congratulations on reaching the end of this book. I hope that it has been a fun journey and that I have conveyed some of the joy that I get from working every day on F# codebases. Even if you don't get the chance to work in F#, many of the ideas and practices in this book will still positively impact the way that you think about and write code every day.

Programming in F# is different from working in C#. It's not just about the language features or the paradigm but it's the way that you are encouraged to explore different solutions to problems with minimal cost.

My F# ethos is:

> **First make it run, then make it pretty, and finally, if you need to, make it faster.**
>
> (I think I first heard this from the late Joe Armstrong, one of the creators of Erlang).

We have covered a lot in just under 200 pages! During the course of reading this book, you have been introduced to the essentials of F#:

- F# Interactive (FSI)
- Algebraic Type System
  - Records
  - Discriminated Unions
  - Tuples
- Pattern Matching
  - Active Patterns
  - Guard Clauses
- Let bindings
- Immutability
- Functions
  - Pure
  - Higher-Order
  - Currying
  - Partial Application
  - Pipelining
  - Signatures
  - Composition
- Unit
- Effects
  - Option
  - Result
  - Async
  - Task
- Computation Expressions
- Collections
  - Lists
  - Sequences
  - Arrays
  - Sets
- Recursion
- Object Programming
  - Class types
  - Interfaces
  - Object Expressions
- Exceptions
- Unit Tests
- Namespaces and Modules

You've also started the journey towards writing APIs and websites in Giraffe.

What makes F# such a wonderful language to use is not just the individual features but how they work together; It's the epitome of Aristotle's oft-quoted words:

> The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

## F# Software Foundation

Thank you for purchasing this book. All of the author's royalties will be going to the F# Software Foundation to support their efforts in promoting the F# language and community to the world.
