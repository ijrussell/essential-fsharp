# Essential F\# Book

F# is a programming language for the .NET Platform that encourages a functional-first style of programming. This ebook is targeted at folks wanting to learn F# and assumes that the reader has little knowledge of F# or functional programming. Some programming experience, particularly using .NET with C# or VB.NET, may be useful but is not necessary.
